__Motivation__: Many people are unaware of factors such as protein, sugar, and caloric intake in their personal, daily diets. We created a simple and effective way for people to reflect on their diets through our web app. The user can select food products they ate in a given day and view the total nutritional content of their diet that day.

__Features__: Our web app is responsive and simple to use. We implemented a fuzzy search technique so that the user can type the name and brand of a food product and scroll through the potential matches to select the one they are looking for. The user can add as many food products as they wish and then click the "Calculate Daily Nutrition" button to view their total protein, sugar, and caloric intake.

__How to run the web app__: To start the back end, refer to the README file in our backend directory. Once the back end api is running, open a new terminal to start the front end. For this, you need to have npm installed. Once you do, you can navigate to the frontend directory in your terminal and run `npm run dev`. Click the link provided, and now you can use our web app locally!
